# How to build a mobile NFT marketplace for Starknet

In this tutorial, we will build a mobile NFT marketplace for Starknet. The marketplace will allow users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs.

We will use the [Ark protocol](https://www.arkproject.dev).

1. Create a new flutter project

```sh
flutter create nft_marketplace
```

Run it locally with `flutter run` to make sure it is properly configured (run on IOS or Android, web and desktop not yet supported).

2. Clone the ark project and run it locally ([follow README instructions](https://github.com/ArkProjectNFTs/ark-project/blob/bcd8ce9a6a83eeeb358c102def2f924af03b09a7/README.md?plain=1#L112-L172)):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ArkProjectNFTs/ark-project.git
```

3. Install `wallet_kit` and its dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_riverpod hive_flutter wallet_kit
```

Modify the main entrypoint to setup hive and riverpod (required for `wallet_kit`):

```dart
void main() async {
  await Hive.initFlutter();
  runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```
