# How to contribute

**starknet.dart** is a dart package allowing any dart program (mainly Flutter apps) to communicate with the [Starknet](https://starknet.io/docs/) blockchain.

The [Starknet nodes](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/06ea631557937d4319aa539a2021e312ec757ac2/crates/pathfinder/src/rpc.rs) expose a JSON-RPC API (see the [specs](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs)) that we can call to call Smart Contract methods or even get information on blocks and past transactions.

The goal of the project is thus to build a bridge between dart applications and Starknet, while staying consistent with the common abstractions used in other blockchain SDKs (see [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)).

## Why contribute to starknet.dart?

Starknet is a revolution in the web3 world: it allows to [scale Ethereum](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/) and offers the best UX one can dream of on a blockchain thanks to unique features like [account abstraction](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/wtf-is-account-abstraction/) or [session keys](https://github.com/dontpanicdao/starknet-burner).

But web3 mainstream adoption won't happen unless decentralized applications go to mobile. That's why it's a priority to build the best possible Starknet SDK for Flutter, one of the most used cross-platform mobile frameworks.

If you want to contribute to the web3 adoption and more specifically Starknet one, then you probably **can't have more impact than working on this SDK** that will be used by the majority of Flutter dApps on Starknet!

### To become a core contributor

After a few qualitative contributions, we'll probably offer you to join the core team to become a maintainer of the project.

If you want to contribute to the project, you can follow the steps below:

1. Join our [telegram group](https://t.me/+CWezjfLIRYc0MDY0) and introduce yourself.
2. We'll let you know what are good issues to start with.
3. Create your account on [Only Dust](https://app.onlydust.com/p/starknetdart).

## How to set up your dev env

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:focustree/starknet.dart.git
```

2. [Install flutter and dart](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

3. Install [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/~melos-latest/getting-started):

```sh
dart pub global activate melos
```

We use melos to manage our monorepo:

- Run `melos bs` to fetch deps
- Run `melos format` to format all packages
- Run `melos test` to run tests
- Run `melos publish` to publish all packages

4. Fetch all dependencies:

```sh
melos bootstrap
```

5. Set up your starknet dev env. First install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), then run:

```sh
source .env.devnet # Load the env variables
melos starknet:setup
```

## How to run the tests

Start the devnet in one terminal:

```sh
melos devnet:start
```

Then run the tests in another terminal:

```sh
melos test
```

## How to update devnet dump

Start the devnet in dump mode:

```sh
melos devnet:start:dump
```

Then deploy contracts to devnet:

```sh
melos devnet:setup
```

Then kill the devnet, that's it the `assets/devnet-dump.json` has been updated!

## Repo structure

- `/contracts` contains all the contracts we use in the project. We prefix the folder by the cairo version we use.
- `/packages` contains all the packages we use in the project.
  - `starknet` contains the core logic with crypto hash functions and the main utility classes.
  - `starknet_provider` contains the main package that we use to interact with the Starknet rpc nodes.
  - `secure_store` manages the secure storage of the private key using different methods depending on the platform.
  - `walletkit` is a higher level ui kit to manage wallets and transactions in a flutter app.
- `/examples` contains examples of apps using the packages. They should be accompanied by a tutorial in the docs to reproduce the app from scratch.
- `/docs` contains the documentation of the project. Docs are automatically deployed when we merge to main.

### Generate freezed model classes

To avoid writing too much boilerplate, we use the [freezed](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed) library to automatically generate serializer logic.

You can run the following command to generate those classes:

```
dart run build_runner build
```

Alternatively, you can hit `Cmd + Shift + B` in vscode.

## Troubleshooting

Tools need to be at the right version to avoid any incompability:
